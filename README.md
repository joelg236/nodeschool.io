nodeschool.io
=============

My solutions for all nodeschool.io workshops - working through them daily.

I'm trying to do them all without looking at solutions or googling too much, but obviously libraries are an exception. I'm not a perfectionist, and my only requirement for solutions is to pass the verify tests.

Plan is to complete all core and elective workshops. (with exception of "git-it")
